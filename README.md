Reddit

A front-end application mimicking the user interface of Reddit. Developed using React, Redux, and Styled-components.

Introduction

This project is an attempt to recreate the look and feel of the Reddit platform. While it has been a challenging endeavor, especially given the limitations of the free APIs used, the final result captures the essence of Reddit's user experience, especially on mobile devices.

Features

Reddit-like UI: Emulating the Reddit user interface using Styled-components for a seamless user experience.

Mobile Navbar: A feature-rich mobile navigation bar, which was a particular point of focus and required significant iteration and effort to perfect.

Responsive Design: The app has been designed to be responsive across various screen sizes, with a particular emphasis on mobile.

Limitations

API Constraints: Due to the use of free APIs, there were instances of prolonged wait times and occasional fetch crashes. To counteract this, generic logos have been used for elements like user avatars and top communities.

Tech Stack

React: For building the user interface and handling the state.

Redux: To manage the app's state in a predictable manner.

Styled-components: All of the styling for this project was accomplished using Styled-components. This provided a clean and modular approach to styling.
